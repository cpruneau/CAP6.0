//!
//!Task used for the determination of multiplicity moments of second, third, and fourth order. These moments
//!can then be used, in a "derived" stage, to compute cumulants of 2nd, 3rd, and 4th order, as well as other
//!variables such as the nu-dynamic variable.
//!As for other task classes of this package, the computation can be carried out for one or  several event class types (selected by the
//!user supplied event filters) and for one or several particle filters (selected by the user as particle filters). It is then possible to calculate
//!moments, cumulants, and various combinations of these for specific kinematic ranges or specific particle types or both.
//!The moments are computed as integrated averages and as function of some global event characteristic or property. The specific
//!property used as independent variable to compute (and eventually plot) the moments, cumulants, etc, is selected based on the  inputType
//!parameter selected at construction of an instance of this class.
